@cmp{Demo-CollectionEditLine-Example1}#headerText=CollectionGroup Edit Line Default
@cmp{Demo-CollectionEditLine-Example1}#instructionalText=[b]Default CollectionGroup edit line[/b][br/]This demo shows the default behavior of a collection's edit line in dialog without custom edit line items nor custom actions. In this case, the edit line dialog items default to the items in the collection group (in this example, the fields are 'field1' and 'field2'), and the actions default to their respective prototypes. There are 2 default actions, the edit line in dialog line action, which displays the edit line dialog with the current line items to edit, and the other is the save changes action, which is displayed in the edit line dialog to save the changes made to the current line by invoking the controller's saveLine method.
